 Hello this is my repository consists of various useful programs made into header files. Anyone can fork the repository as they wish. All the programs are checked using gcc compiler.
 
 money_transfer.h is a header file consisting of an atm function that tries to mimick the work of a real life atm. It returns nothing so a simple call of atm() function will do its job. Feel free to post any issues and I will try my best to solve it.ACCESS CODE is 2020. Feel free to tinker with it declared as a constant integer at line 15.

 The executable binary files are also provided in the 'executable files' folder which people can run directly without any compiler.
